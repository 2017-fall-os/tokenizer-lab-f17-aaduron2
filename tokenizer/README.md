# Tokenizer

About
-----

A tokenizer that parses strings inputted by a user.

Installation
------------

A makefile was created to compile the necessary files.

To compile the program, simply make your way to the tokenizer folder and enter the following command:

   ~~~
   $ make all
   ~~~
   
   You may then start the program with the following command:

   ~~~
   $ ./test
   ~~~
   
Instructions
------------

You'll notice that it starts with an identical look to a regular command prompt as such:

   ~~~
   $ 
   ~~~
   
Everytime you hit enter, it'll parse the string you have inputted and should display each string you inputted on different lines to show it has succeeded.


List of Known Issues
--------------------

- It will not parse a string unless there is an empty space at the end of the string.


Resources / References
----------------------

This program does use snippets of code provided by resources found from the web or
the current courses that I'm taking that provided a guideline in which to follow for my program
to work.
