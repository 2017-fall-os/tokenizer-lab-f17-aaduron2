# Tokenizer

About
-----

A tokenizer that parses strings inputted by a user.

Installation
------------

A makefile was created to compile the necessary files.

To compile the program, simply make your way to the tokenizer folder and enter the following command:

   ~~~
   $ make all
   ~~~
   
   You may then start the program with the following command:

   ~~~
   $ ./test
   ~~~
   
Instructions
-------------

Tokenizer starts by asking for a delimiter that is limited to a char:


   ~~~
   Enter delimiter value:
   ~~~

After the delimiter is set, you may begin tokenizing your input string:

   ~~~
   $ 
   ~~~
   
Everytime you hit enter, it'll parse the string you have inputted and should display each string inputted on different lines to show it has succeeded.
   
To exit tokenizer, simply type "exit":

   ~~~
   $ exit
   ~~~

This program does use snippets of code provided by resources found from the web or
the current courses that I'm taking that provided a guideline in which to follow for my program
to work.
